# Connect Four AI

My (next) attempt to write a Connect Four AI powered by machine learning.

## Training

Run `cargo run --release` in the `train` crate folder. It takes some time until a good model comes out.

## Playing

1. Link or copy the appropriate model to the `connect-four` crate folder.
2. Make sure the code picks up the correct model for the correct file. Modify the code to play against a different model. (TODO)
3. Run `cargo run --release` and play the game.
